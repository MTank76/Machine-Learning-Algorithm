# Machine Learning Algorithms in Python

This repository contains Python implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms, including K-Means Clustering (`kmeans.py`), Linear Regression (`linear.ipynb`), Logistic Regression (`logistic.ipynb`), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) (`svm.ipynb`).

## Algorithms Included

### 1. K-Means Clustering (`kmeans.py`)
- **Description:** K-Means is an unsupervised clustering algorithm used to partition data into K clusters based on similarity.
- **Implementation:** The `kmeans.py` file contains the implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm to group data points into clusters.

### 2. Linear Regression (`linear.ipynb`)
- **Description:** Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
- **Implementation:** The `linear.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression for predictive modeling.

### 3. Logistic Regression (`logistic.ipynb`)
- **Description:** Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm used for binary and multi-class classification tasks.
- **Implementation:** The `logistic.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook showcases Logistic Regression's implementation for classification problems.

### 4. Support Vector Machine (SVM) (`svm.ipynb`)
- **Description:** SVM is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression analysis by creating a hyperplane that best separates classes.
- **Implementation:** The `svm.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook provides an implementation of SVM for classification tasks.
